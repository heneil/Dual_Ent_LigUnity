        <strong>On the cover:</strong> This ocean symbolizes the human proteome—the complete set of proteins that carry out essential functions in our bodies. For medicine to work, it often needs to interact with a specific protein. For an estimated 90% of these proteins, however, they lack known small-molecule ligands with high activity. In the image, these proteins are represented as sailboats drifting in the dark.

Its beam illuminates several sailboats, guiding them toward glowing buoys, which symbolize ligands with high activity found by LigUnity. The work by Feng et al. highlights the power of AI-driven computational methods to efficiently find active ligands and optimize their activity, opening up new therapeutic avenues for various diseases.

## Abstract

Protein-ligand binding affinity plays an important role in drug discovery, especially during virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization. Computational chemistry and machine learning methods have been developed to investigate these tasks. Despite the encouraging performance, virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization are often studied separately by existing methods, partially because they are performed sequentially in the existing drug discovery pipeline, thereby overlooking their interdependency and complementarity. To address this problem, we propose LigUnity, a foundation model for protein-ligand binding prediction by jointly optimizing virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization. 
In particular, LigUnity learns coarse-grained active/inactive distinction for virtual screening, and fine-grained pocket-specific ligand preference for hit-to-lead optimization. 
We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of LigUnity on eight benchmarks across virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization. In virtual screening, LigUnity outperforms 24 competing methods with more than 50% improvement on the DUD-E and Dekois 2.0 benchmarks, and shows robust generalization to novel proteins. In hit-to-lead optimization, LigUnity achieves the best performance on split-by-time, split-by-scaffold, and split-by-unit settings, further demonstrating its potential as a cost-effective alternative to free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. We further showcase how LigUnity can be employed in an active learning framework to efficiently identify active ligands for TYK2, a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases, yielding over 40% improved prediction performance. Collectively, these comprehensive results establish LigUnity as a versatile foundation model for both virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization, offering broad applicability across the drug discovery pipeline through accurate protein-ligand affinity predictions.



## Reproduce results in our paper

### Reproduce results on FEP benchmarks (zero-shot)

Please first download checkpoints before running
- Clone model checkpoint from https://huggingface.co/fengb/LigUnity_pocket_ranking and https://huggingface.co/fengb/LigUnity_protein_ranking (test ligands and assays in FEP benchmarks are removed from the training set)

```
# run pocket/protein and ligand encoder model
for r in {1..6} do
    path2weight="path to checkpoint of pocket_ranking"
    path2result="./result/pocket_ranking/FEP/repeat_{r}"
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 bash test.sh FEP pocket_ranking ${path2weight} ${path2result}
    
    path2weight="path to checkpoint of protein_ranking"

```

### Reproduce results on active learning
to speed up the active learning process, you should modify the unicore code 
1. find the installed dir of unicore (root-to-unicore)
```
python -c "import unicore; print('/'.join(unicore.__file__.split('/')[:-2]))"
```

2. goto root-to-unicore/unicore/options.py line 250, add following line
```
    group.add_argument('--validate-begin-epoch', type=int, default=0, metavar='N',
                        help='validate begin epoch')
```

3. goto root-to-unicore/unicore_cli/train.py line 303, add one line
```
    do_validate = (
        (not end_of_epoch and do_save)
        or (
            end_of_epoch
            and epoch_itr.epoch >= args.validate_begin_epoch # !!!! add this line
            and epoch_itr.epoch % args.validate_interval == 0
            and not args.no_epoch_checkpoints
        )
        or should_stop
        or (
            args.validate_interval_updates > 0
            and num_updates > 0
            and num_updates % args.validate_interval_updates == 0
        )
    ) and not args.disable_validation
```

4. run the active learning procedure
```
# use the same checkpoints as in FEP experiments
path1="path to checkpoint of pocket_ranking"
path2="path to checkpoint of protein_ranking"
result1="./result/pocket_ranking/TYK2"
result2="./result/protein_ranking/TYK2"

# run active learning cycle for 5 iters with pure greedy strategy
bash ./active_learning_scripts/run_al.sh 5 0 path1 path2 result1 result2
```
